    "description": "We welcome you to experience Colonial Williamsburg in a way you've never done before! This fun self guided interactive GPS tour of Colonial Williamsburg and the College of William and Mary will take you to more than 150 locations throughout Colonial Williamsburg, with nearly three hours of audio narration by voice actors to tell you everything you need to know about this historic hotspot. No more walking in front of a place and thinking, What is this, what was it for, and why is it important? Simply walk in front of a house or find it on the map or list to listen to its story! Williamsburg was founded in 1632. Originally named Middle Plantation, Royal Governor Francis Nicholson changed its name to Williamsburg in honor of King William III. The nation's second oldest College was established here in 1693, the College of William and Mary, which became America's first University in 1779 with the first law school. Williamsburg became the capital of Virginia in 1699 after the capital building in Jamestown burned down in 1698. It served as the capital of the Virginia Colony and cultural and social center of the wealthiest and largest colony until 1780, when the capital moved to Richmond. Under the leadership of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, George Mason, Patrick Henry and James Madison, Williamsburg was a center of political activity in the years leading up to the American Revolution. Today you will experience Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum that includes hundreds of houses, structures, and outbuildings. 88 are original. Outbuildings such as smokehouses, privies and kitchens have been faithfully reproduced, and the original buildings were restored to show how they would have looked during the eighteenth century. Many buildings are open as museums, while others are used to demonstrate period trades such as the wheelwright's shop, printing shop, gunsmith and wigmaker's establishment. Some buildings are also used as stores, where visitors can purchase items that were created by historic tradespeople at Colonial Williamsburg. Join us as we take you on a fun GPS guided audio experience through the streets of Colonial Williamsburg and to the College of William and Mary!",

    "description": "It is no surprise that the small Pennsylvania town of Gettysburg is one of the most haunted cities in the United States. The Battle of Gettysburg, known as the turning point of the Civil War, was the bloodiest battle between the Union and the Confederate forces, with casualties totaling nearly 51,000. During the sweltering days of July 1st - July 3rd, the quiet town of Gettysburg transformed into hell on earth as the sounds of rifles, cannons, and the screams of men and horses resounded into makeshift fields hospitals. Gettysburg's gruesome history and the strange encounters that many experience leaves little doubt as to why tourists, locals, noted psychics, and paranormal professionals declare the area to be haunted. Places with ghastly monikers like 'Devil's Den,' 'The Valley of Death,' 'Bloody Run,' and 'Slaughter Pen' have all been reported as haunted, where apparitions reportedly appear. Prepare to take a harrowing journey through a town that ran red with blood and still may be the home to wandering spirits, whose lives were cut short during those bloody days in July 1863.",

In nearly three centuries perched on an unstable edge of the continent, disasters nearly countless have been visited upon this city. Fires, floods, plagues and war have each in turn taken their swipe at the Crescent City. In many years the death rate would approach ten percent of the population; today the dead outnumber the living in the city by nearly twelve to one. Wedged between a mighty river and a tidal lake, surrounded by swamp, water enfolds the city in abundance. Ever moving and full of energy, water is believed to give power to the countless spirits trapped within the confines of the city. Lives cut short by calamity fill the narrow streets and crooked buildings of the city. Wracked by death, disease, and destruction, this is a fertile breeding ground for hauntings of all descriptions.

    "title": "Jack the Ripper's London",
    "description": "Retrace the steps of Jack the Ripper's gruesome trail of murder in London as we take you to the scenes of the crimes and other key locations. The autumn of 1888 proved to be an unforgettable period in the history of London's Whitechapel district. This was the time when the terrible spectre of Jack the Ripper raised his infamous head and stalked the dark streets and damp alleyways of this impoverish borough of London. During what became known as the Whitechapel Murders, the murky, misty cobbled maze of passageways saw eleven women lose their lives. Of the eleven murders committed in Whitechapel that year, the atrocious murders of five women linked to Jack the Ripper were the most horrifying and gruesome. 19th century London was at the centre of the world. It was the capital of the British Empire, the largest city at the time, and as today, it was a meeting place for a wide multicultural, melting pot of people. The streets around Whitechapel and Spitelfields were home to some of the most destitute people in the capital, who came from all over the world to scratch out a living in the docks, markets and stalls around the area. The main roads were lit with naphtha gaslights that cast a yellow haze through the bleak misty air, in many places the cobbles were damaged and large inky black pools would gather and everywhere there was the heavy stench from the open sewers that criss crossed the city. It was amongst this chaos that many of the poorest women earned a little extra money through prostituting themselves on these inhospitable streets. A desperate measure, as it was dangerous, dirty, and did not pay well. Disease was rife, beatings common and murder always a possibility. The money made could be as low as three pence a time and occasionally, such as when times were hard, even a piece of stale bread would be accepted. Three pence however, was the going rate, as this was the price for temporary relief, in the form of the cost for a large gin. So it was in the dark corridors, disgusting tight passageways and sodden wet courtyards that the women of Whitechapel plied their trade. It was so common, that everyone turned a blind eye to the cavorting couples in the deep shadows. The Jack the Ripper murders, apart from their sheer brutality and fact that the perpetrator was never caught, have lived long in the memory for many reasons. This was the world's first truly international serial killing made for newspapers. Literacy, printing and the tabloids were rapidly growing and the case was reported in all its horror. An insatiable desire for gory details meant reporters uncovered everything possible, and in come cases contrived or invented information. Suspects ranged from princes and famous authors, to respected doctors and international criminals. No one was safe in having the finger of suspicion pointed at them. The first body, that of Mary Nichols, was one of the first murder victims to be photographed in the world and the first use of criminal profiling by medical doctor Thomas Bond. All this has led to a cult fascination with the 1888 Whitechapel Murders, a true Victorian Murder Mystery.",

    "description": "Portland, Oregon is not the first city one thinks of when picturing dark and evil deeds. It is known to be an artistic, friendly city, nestled on the rainy West Coast. Founded in 1845, the city is relatively young in the history of our country. But this has been more than enough time for a seedy underbelly to have cropped up in Portland. The city has a rich history full of terrible people and worse events, leaving an ever-present heaviness in some areas. Portland is a welcoming city but there are still some darker sides beneath this rosy facade, (sometimes literally) hiding just beneath the surface.",

    "description": "Hello, and welcome to iTourMobile's Hollywood Journey. We will take you to 30 destinations and show you some of the most spectacular sights that Hollywood has to offer. It doesn't matter if you're a traveling tourist or a California native, this tour will take you on a fun trip through Hollywood. Whether it's your first or 50th time visiting these ever so popular destinations, there are always new details waiting to discover. Now who's ready to have some fun in the sun and begin this History of Hollywood tour?! Most can agree that the name Hollywood invokes thoughts of celebrities, fame, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, eclectic fashion, and lots of cheesy souvenirs. With this town's rich history and vibrant on-going nightlife, most people don't even know its true origins and rich cultural importance to California and the world. Let us begin our journey from past to present and help you understand what the land of Hollywood is really made of. Along this tour there will be something for everybody including interesting buildings, museums, shops and restaurants. Stops will include places where the people of Hollywood played, danced, drank, sang, and fell in love. Hollywood's exciting community was once the most glamorous place to live in the world. As the playground of the stars, this town has been working hard to renew itself and in the process, bring back the embodiment of excitement and adventure that it once exuded. While some of these landmarks still exist, many have been lost to fire, renovation, or relocation. This urban landscape is full of history, hidden treasures and is now one of the country's most productive sources of employment and entertainment. The Hollywood district, one of the many districts in Los Angeles, is regarded as one of the liveliest places in the world with its nickname as 'Tinseltown.' In February 2006, Assembly members introduced a bill to specify the geographical boundaries of Hollywood. On Aug. 28, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger approved the bill, and Hollywood's official boarders include Beverly Hills on the east, Mulholland Drive, Laurel Canyon, Barham Blvd and Cahuenga Blvd on the south, Melrose Ave on the north and Hyperion Ave and the Golden State Freeway to its west. According to the 2000 census, here are some facts about this district: the current population comprised of about 300,000 people, covering a total area of 24.96 square miles. The population density consists of 8,443 people per square mile. The racial makeup of the community was 59.84% white, 47.27% white non-Hispanic, 9.44% Asian, 4.28% black, 0.62% Native American, 0.13% Pacific Islander, 19.10% from other races, and 6.59% were multiracial. 49.63% of the population was born in foreign countries. Hollywood is currently labeled a district and not officially a city. Noted as the current historical center of American cinema, Hollywood made its debut in the mid-1850s as an agriculturally flourished community with thriving crops of many common and exotic varieties. In the 1870s, residents came to call the area Cahuenga Valley, named after the pass in the Santa Monica Mountains to the north. Soon after, the land was subdivided into large plots with an influx of homeowners. First coined by H.J. Whitley, the name Hollywood was conspired after he became known as the \"Father of Hollywood.\" The name slowly made its way around town. A prominent investor, H.H. Wilcox, sold his deed to the LA County Recorder's office on Feb. 1, 1887, land that would become Hollywood. This was the beginning of a beautiful story of a place that would blossom into the home of the film industry. Welcome to Hollywood! Written by iTourMobile's Sasha Ramazani and team.",

Join us as we take you on a short journey to more than twelve of Chicago's most notable and inspiring structures to explore the different architecture styles used throughout the city. The city of Chicago features more than twenty skyscrapers and many prominent buildings in a variety of styles by many important architects. \r\n\r\nSince the Great Chicago Fire destroyed most of the buildings within the downtown area in 1871, Chicagos buildings are noted for their originality rather than their antiquity. Chicago was the first to use steel in its structural frame and would rival New York in the vertical skyscraper race. It was here, in Chicago, that architects introduced the Chicago School of architecture and introduced a new era of skyscrapers, design, and construction.",

The dramatic increase of interest in The Godfather provided Francis Ford Coppola the opportunity to film the movie in real locations, and not solely on a set in Hollywood. In fact, production notes state that only ten percent of the film was shot on sound stages. Francis Ford Coppola wanted to film in the streets of New York and in Sicily, Vito Corleone's native country, to ensure that those who decided to watch the film would feel as if they were in the film with the characters. Luckily, Coppola's wish came true. He was able to shut down East Sixth Street in New York to give the viewers a genuine feel of what Little Italy actually looked like in young Vito's time. Many of the scenes were filmed in actual places where people were living. The crew spent months creating new lampposts to emulate the antique lamps, removed traffic lights, and created store front signs to create a genuine view of the old Little Italy. The Godfather is one of the best films ever made, thanks to Francis Ford Coppola's attention to detail, the talented film staff supporting him, and The Godfather's compelling storyline.",
