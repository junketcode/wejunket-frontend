              <strong>Electronic Newsletter Policy</strong> - We may provide a
              free electronic newsletter to users and interested clients. ITour
              Mobile gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily
              subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sharing policy</strong>- Our application allows users to
              choose to share a point of interest on a tour, the application, or
              an experience through email, text, or social media. The user must
              provide their account information (usually email address or
              integrate with facebook app) and/or that of the recipient. This
              information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of
              course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The
              information is not used for any other purpose.

            <li>
              <strong>Surveys</strong>- ITour Mobile provides a voluntary survey
              feature for clients. The survey data is sent to the client and
              aggregated. The company may occasionally conduct user surveys to
              better target our content to our audience. We never share any of
              this information about specific individuals with any third party.

            Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
            of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally
            identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without

          <h1><strong>Usage tracking</strong></h1>
          <p>
            ITour Mobile tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our
            experiences, including time spent at each stop. However, we do not
            collect individual data to pair this with, nor do we correlate this
            information with data about individual users. ITour Mobile does break
            down overall usage statistics according to a user’s domain name,
            browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the
            browser string (information contained in every user’s browser).
          </p>
          <p>
            ITour Mobile sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users
            enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated
            with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which
            areas of our sites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those
            areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well
            each page performs overall. This helps us to build a better service
            for our clients and users.

            although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to
            information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the
            only personal information a cookie can contain is information you

            <strong>USE OF INFORMATION</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            ITour Mobile uses any information voluntarily given by our users to
            enhance their experience in our site, whether to provide interactive
            or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future
            content based on the interests of our users.
          </p>
          <p>
            As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in
            order to display information to other users and to enable users to
            participate in surveys, newsletters, and forums. We may send out
            newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule. ITour Mobile never
            shares newsletter mailing lists with third parties, including
            advertisers, sponsors or partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites
            users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas, we do not
            track what individual users read, but rather how well each page
            performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service. We
            track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures
            of what interests our users.

            ITour Mobile uses the above-described information to tailor our
            content to suit the needs of clients and users, and help to better
            understand our audience’s demographics. We will not share information
            about individual users with any third party, except to comply with
            applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal
            safety of our users or the public.

            <strong>OPT-OUT POLICY</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.</li>
            <li>
              Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which
              completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable
              information from our users.
