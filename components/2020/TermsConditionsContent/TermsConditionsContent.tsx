            <strong>TERM AND TERMINATION</strong>- This EULA and your right to use
            the Junket application will take effect at the moment you click
            “I ACCEPT” or you install, access, or use the Junket application
            and is effective until terminated as set forth below. This EULA will
            terminate automatically if you click “I REJECT”. In addition, Company
            reserves the right at any time and on reasonable grounds, which shall
            include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraudulent or
            unlawful activity or actions or omissions that violate any term or
            condition of this EULA, to deny your access to the Junket
            application or to any portion thereof in order to protect its name and
            goodwill, its business, and/or other Authorized Users, and this EULA
            will also terminate automatically if you fail to comply with this

            termination, as identified below. In addition to the miscellaneous
            section below, the provisions concerning Company’s proprietary rights,
            feedback, indemnity, disclaimers of warranty, limitation of liability,

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong>- You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual,
            of this EULA will cause irreparable injury to Company, such injury
            would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and Company would not
            have an adequate remedy at law. You therefore agree that Company shall
            be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be
            awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a
            court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or
            actual, of your obligations under any provision of this EULA.
            Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that Company post any
            bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief
            is sought by or awarded to Company to enforce any provision of this
            EULA. The parties agree that this EULA is for the benefit of the
            parties hereto as well as Company’s licensors. Accordingly, this EULA
            is personal to you, and you may not assign your rights or obligations
            to any other person or entity without Company’s prior written consent.
            Failure by Company to insist on strict performance of any of the terms
            and conditions of this EULA will not operate as a waiver by Company of
            that or any subsequent default or failure of performance. If any
            provision (or part thereof) contained in this EULA is determined to be
            void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent
            jurisdiction or on account of a conflict with an applicable government
            regulation, such determination shall not affect the remaining
            provisions (or parts thereof) contained herein and the illegal,
            invalid, or unenforceable clause shall be modified in compliance with
            applicable law in a manner that most closely matches the intent of the
            original language. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or
            agency relationship exists between you and Company as a result of this
            EULA or your utilization of the Junket application. Headings
            herein are for convenience only. This EULA represents the entire
            agreement between you and Company with respect to use of the
            Junket application, and it supersedes all prior or
            contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic,
            oral, or written between you and Company with respect to the
            Junket application.

Accordingly, you may choose the type of subscription you want to avail. You will be liable to pay Junket in accordance with your Subscription Plan. You may increase the number of Junkets and User Applications under your Subscription Plan at any time during the term of your Subscription by increasing the number of Authorized Users under your Account and payment of the necessary fee for the additional Junkets and features or Applications in accordance with Section 7(b).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>a.

We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including your credit card number (or other payment information), the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, “Payment Information”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information.

By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Junket. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or Subscription in accordance with these Terms.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>c.	Effect of Termination on Subscription.</strong> Our general policy is that YOUR PURCHASE IS FINAL AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CANCEL THE PURCHASE AND/OR RECEIVE A REFUND OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE AT ANY TIME.

          <p>
            These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Virginia, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Junket are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Richmond, Virginia, and you and Junket each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h1>17. Dispute Resolution</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>a.	Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</strong> We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Junket agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Junket are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>b.	Exceptions and Opt-out.</strong> As limited exceptions to Section 17(a) above: (i) you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. In addition, you will retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email at <a>contact@wejunket.com</a> or by regular mail at PO Box 5757, Williamsburg, VA 23230, USA within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>c.	Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.</strong> The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>d.	Arbitration Costs.</strong> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. We’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>e.	Class Action Waiver.</strong> YOU AND JUNKET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>f.	Effect of Changes on Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 “Changes to Terms or Services” above, if Junket changes any of the terms of this Section 17 “Dispute Resolution” after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to contact@wejunket.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Effective Date” above or in the date of Junket’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Junket in accordance with the terms of this Section 17 “Dispute Resolution” as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>g.	Severability.</strong>  With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17(e) of these Terms ("Class Action Waiver"), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

          <h1>18. General Terms</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>a.	Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Junket and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Junket and you regarding the Services and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Junket’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Junket may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>b.	Notices.</strong> Any notices or other communications provided by Junket under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>c.	Waiver of Rights.</strong> Junket’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Junket. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
